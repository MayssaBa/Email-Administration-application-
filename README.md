<h1>Email Administration System</h1>

This repository contains Java code for an Email Administration System designed to facilitate the creation of work email accounts for new employees. The system generates a new employee's work email, assigns a random password (which can be changed later), specifies a mailbox capacity, and prompts the employee for an alternative email address.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h4>Employee Email Generation:</h4>

Upon running the program, the system will automatically generate a work email for the new employee.

<h4>Random Password Assignment:</h4>

The system assigns a random password to the employee, providing an initial secure login. The employee has the option to change the password later.

<h4>Mailbox Capacity:</h4>

A specific mailbox capacity is set for each employee to manage their email storage.

<h4>Alternative Email Prompt:</h4>

The employee is prompted to provide an alternative email address for communication purposes.

<h3>Customize</h3>

Feel free to customize the code to suit your organization's specific requirements or add additional features as needed.
